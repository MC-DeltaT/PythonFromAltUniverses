"Modern Python from Alternate Universes"


Purpose:
    About modern Python techniques inspired by other languages.
    Don't tell people how to do stuff, just present ideas to inspire.


Topics:
    Type hints for general static typing. The basics, numbers, containers, etc.
    Parameterising things on types (like C++ templates or Java generics).
    Type var bounds (like Java/C++ generics constraints).
    Deduced self type (like C++ CRTP? or C++23 deduced this. Or Scala and OCaml self?).
    Using type arguments at runtime? (Like C++ templates or C# reified generics).
    Protocols (like C++ concepts/constraints. Or OCaml, Go).
    Pattern matching for returning error values (like Erlang, Elixir).
    Dataclasses? Simple immutable types plus type hinting support.
